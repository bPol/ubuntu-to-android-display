# ubuntu-to-android-display

Extend your **Ubuntu (Wayland/Sway)** desktop to an **Android tablet** over USB ‚Äî stable, wired, and simple.

After a long search for a reliable Wayland solution to use my Android tablet as a second screen, I built this minimal setup.  
It reuses a single virtual (‚Äúheadless‚Äù) display in Sway and streams it to the tablet using **WayVNC**, toggled directly from **Waybar**.
